These solutions were created by following the NAudio tutorials provided by GiawaVideos on YouTube, which I then modified to WPF Applications following the MVVM pattern, largely as I wanted to re-familiarise myself with both WPF and MVVM as well as getting to know more about audio programming.

NAudio is an open source .NET audio library created by Mark Heath which you can find at https://github.com/NAudio/NAudio
